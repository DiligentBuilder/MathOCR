# MathOCR (Reader of Math Images)

Does OCR with math and does different functions after the math is recognized

main.py -> main code for the OCR, calls the different libraries that are used to perform the Math OCR tasks.

## Project Overview

My project idea is a reader for written mathematical equations that can automatically do calculations
for simple (and progressively more complex, depending on how much time I have) mathematical
equations. The project will utilize image processing techniques to do recognition of the different digits
and mathematical notations and symbols and be able to read mathematical notation to figure out what
the equation that the camera is reading is supposed to be. Image processing techniques and libraries
will be used to do the digit recognition and the symbol recognition to recognize the mathematical
notation, and the answer to the scanned mathematical expression will be automatically calculated and
outputted onto a screen.


## Function 1. Recognize the handwritten math and display it


## Function 2. Convert LATEX code into SymPy code



## Function 3. Do arithmetic using the user input (image of math) and solve the arithmetic
